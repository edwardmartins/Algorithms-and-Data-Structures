# Problem Solving Using Algorithms and Data Structures

![Learning-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-is-Important](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36489953/72691597-d8c7f300-3b26-11ea-9b10-e8240e89fa09.png)

More than **one hundred problems solved** using different algorithms and data structures

The problems are divided by topic, for each topic there are several folders

In each folder you can find a **.cpp file with the solution to the problem** and a **.pdf file with the problem statement**
